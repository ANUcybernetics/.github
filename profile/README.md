# ANU School of Cybernetics

This is the official GitHub organisation for the [ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au).

## Home of the Cybernetic Studio

From the beginning of Cybernetics, [material practice has been a key part of knowledge discovery](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312702032003003). The Cybernetic Studio is a cybernetic community that makes things out of hardware/software/people/stuff to explore cybernetic systems/ideas. The Studio, led by [@benswift](https://github.com/benswift/), is place where ANU School of Cybernetics members (and external partners) come together to tinker, to try new ideas (and sometimes fail), and ultimately to build new things and new knowledge together.

The Cybernetic Studio is committed to sharing the things we make through open source software. We do encourage you to have a look through the repos we've got hosted here and see the messiness and the [mangle of practice](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3642386.html) as our thinking evolves.  In some cases the software is useful standalone, but in others it's a one part of a broader hardware/software/experiential project. If you'd like to know more about the Cybernetic Studio or any of our projects, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).

Here's a selection of current projects we're particularly excited about.

## PANIC!

[PANIC!](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/panic) (and the related [panic-tda](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/panic-tda)) is a hybrid genAI art installation/complex information processing simulation based around feeding the inputs of various genAI text/image/audio/video models back in to one another in endless feedback loops. If you want to come an see the artwork in person it's permanently installed in the ANU Birch Building (Level 3), but it also travels around (stay tuned to the [School of Cybnernetics website](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au) for tour dates).

## Human-Scale AI

The number-crunching power of Artificial Neural Network algorithms is the foundation of modern computational AI. However, computers are capable of performing these computations---trillions of additions and multiplications per second---far beyond the limits of human perception. The Human-Scale AI project will construct a series of physical devices for performing these same AI number-crunching computations on a human-legible scale (i.e. much bigger and slower than computers can do them).

- The [Perceptron Apparatus](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/perceptron-apparatus) repo contains the source code for creating the laser-cutting & cnc-routing files for a fully-analog calculation apparatus (think "abacus for deep learning").

- [My First LM](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/my-first-lm) is a small command-line tool for processing a text corpus and typesetting it into an N-gram model book (which can be used for all sorts of fun things like a dice-roll-powered proto-ChatGPT).
