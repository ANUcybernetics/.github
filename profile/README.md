# ANU School of Cybernetics

This is the official GitHub organisation for the [ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au).

## Home of the Cybernetic Studio

The Cybernetic Studio is a cybernetic community that makes things out of hardware/software/people/stuff to explore cybernetic systems/ideas. 

From the beginning of Cybernetics, material practice has been a key part of knowledge discovery. This includes Wiener’s hearing glove, Grey Walter’s tortoises, Ashby’s homeostat, Beer and Pask’s fungoid ‘whisper’ systems, and many more examples. 

The Studio, led by [@benswift](https://github.com/benswift/), is place where ANU School of Cybernetics members (and external partners) come together to tinker, to try new ideas (and sometimes fail), and ultimately to build new things and new knowledge together.

The Cybernetic Studio is committed to sharing the things we make through open source software. Have a look around the repos under this GitHub org, and if you'd like to know more about the Cybernetic Studio, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
